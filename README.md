# Heart-Disease-Prediction
The purpose of this project is to find out what are the best predictors among 76 present predictors. This will be done using feature scaling, algorithms such as backward elimination and forward selection. 
Using dataset provided via UCI machine learning repository and using K-NN, Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms We will find out which algorithm provides best accuracy in least amount of time.
